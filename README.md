# Wearable trophies

Allows equipping trophies and other gear as style.

Install on the client (modding [guide](https://youtu.be/L9ljm2eKLrk)).

The changes done by the mod are visible to un-modded clients.

## Features

Equip any trophy or gear as cosmetic style, while keeping the stats from the original item.

Note: Using some items can print warnings to the console but this should be harmless.
