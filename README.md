# Wearable trophies

Allows equipping trophies from the inventory.

Install on the client (modding [guide](https://youtu.be/L9ljm2eKLrk)).

The changes done by the mod are visible to un-modded clients.

## Features

Equip any trophy (with shift key pressed) from the inventory to visually replace the helmet (while still keeping the stats).

Note: Using some items can print warnings to the console but this should be harmless.
